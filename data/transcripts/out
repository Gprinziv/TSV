bills on file today and five of those are on
            
bills
            

            
by
            

            
File item eleven 
            
by 
            

            
today's hearing we will need to impose some 
time limit on testimony
            

            
am going to allow a little bit more time for

            

            

            I believe that we have a quorum so if the secretary could call the
            

            

            

            

            

            

            

            
Thank you so we will 
            
excuse me
            
in 
            

            

            

            

            
a lot worse
            

            
both to this
            

            
three informational hearings on the topic of
            

            

            

            

            
a select committee on 
            
this specific policy area and to share with you just a couple of 
the key findings let me start with this
            

            

            
About twenty five percent.

            
api scores or graduation rate versus 
drop out rate
            
I can assure you this
            
academic success until we do better
            
Thirty six years ago this
            
education of 
            

            
initiatives trying to tackle the same question
            

            
Today 
            
year
            
to 
            
percent of 
            

            
bills
            

            
parents is important for a creating success for the education of 
            

            

            
Most of us know and 
agree that when 
            

            

            
Under current law
            

            
Instead they use district 
averages
            

            

            
communities at a disadvantage
            

            
_report co-authored by our current
            
as well as our current
            

            
should be simple
            

            

            
Another important
            

            
complying with state law
            
utilizes education practices that are based on 
            
However, 
            
thousand 
            
the immediate suspension of
            
monitoring visits by 
            
The suspension was 
announced in the context of reducing travel budgets
            
districts not being monitored for six or seven years.
And, just now the superintendent is trying to
            

            

            
of education code which requires monitoring every three years.
And, the monitoring
            
only speaks to a specific programs
            
it's only specific
            

            

            

            
the very
            

            

            

            
schools
            

            

            

            

            
There's a number of a amendments 

            
In
            
or approaches actually improve academic outcomes of english
            
Again, I believe monitoring is important to determine that the approaches 

            

            
provision of the bill
            
agree
            

            

            
prepare the
            

            

            

            

            

            
in 
            
believe that
            
to 
            

            

            

            
Good afternoon 
            

            

            color
            
parents and the general community what
            

            

            
outcome empowering parents to have a word in their child success
            

            

            

            
the kind of accountability and monitoring that we know strengthens 
_parent governance and we certainly want parents to be able to have access to information as 

            
lack advisory committee so that they are informed first and foremost and 
then they understand how what resources are really 

            
academic performance 
            
it is offers a through a good step in the right direction
            

            
are in support
            
Any witnesses
            

            

            
Doctor 
            
Thank you senator
            
it went through
            

            

            

            
This applies to both
            

            
kids
            
it really isn't serving them well
            

            

            
sister's time
            

            

            

            

            
announced
            

            

            
rather than have something

very good but, before we vote on the bill and ask you to close I just like to make 
one comment and to say that I think this is a very powerful bill
            

            

            
transparency 
            
and then how that is what the decisions are and how that money is 
distributed I believe very strongly that will leverage better decision-making and, 
bring parents to the table as part of that 
            

            
in the long-run so I appreciate you

            
very much
            
take
            

            

            

            
had 
            
masterplan so we can have a comprehensive policy look 
            

            

            

            

            
you very much

upon the system when school to school and district to district 

            

            

            
begin to create uniformity of criteria school to school district to district throughout the 

            
on research
            

            
and 
            
I want to a 
            

            

            
you senator
            

            

            

            
the criteria has created some confusion a among districts within 

            
discussions among stakeholders
            
what should be looked at 
            
be 
            

            

            
in strong support of this important legislation
            

            

            

            

            

            

            

            
to take a sampling of districts and look at their policies not only to match as 

            

            
has been anecdotal so we think this is

much next witness a in opposition thank you my name is to 
net brown and I'm an elementary school teacher and la habra 
city school district and the very north of orange county and 
got up very early this morning about for unless to sleeping children was a 
babysitter at five o'clock this morning because I felt compelled to come here and tell you this morning 
the emperor is wearing new clothes because this 
bill senate bill fifteen thirty is not what it appears to be it 
is not about whether or not we as teachers or we as professionals 
care about children we do or else we wouldn't be in profession that were 
in it's not about whether or not we want 
_teachers in classrooms that would be hurting children 
I have nothing but empathy and other professionals that I work with nothing but 
_for what happened in LA USD there 
is no one that would not say that it was egregious 
it was terrible and it should not happen.
this senate bill is not what it scenes is 
a diversion from the real problem there currently.
And, I believe that the previous testimony would lead us 
to believe that there is that there are no existing laws 
that prevents I dismissal of teachers who you know, 
have sex crimes or 
drugs or these other things there are laws?
That establish _multi-step 
disciplinary process to address allegations of educator misconduct currently 
on the books and windows when I process 
is implemented and utilize properly?
It number one keep students safe.
Number two it's safeguards the integrity of our profession.
The profession that I chose to be and I hold in high esteem.
And, number three it protects due process which I feel 
is a cornerstone of the democracy of our nation due process not 
just for teachers for every citizen of this country.
I believe.
That a deeper issue is we need 
to focus on the real issue here it's not whether or not we 
have a law we do we have a law that works.
What I believe the real issue at stake here 
and in conclusion I would like to bring the attention to what I believe _the real 
issue is the application of the current law and 
to focus it on what I believe is not following 
the protocols that are currently in place in conclusion I would like to 
_declaration?
I've written in signs that I'll submit to the sergeant arms asking the 
_to investigate 
the administrators in 
_USD who did not.
Jews are due diligence and follow the reporting 
mandates.
That I believe _partially the reason that caused the debacles in LA 
There are mandating, 
mandating reporting protocols that should have been followed and I 
have been going 
to all the commission meetings for the last year and also in the media it has been 
childhood that there were reporting procedures that were not followed I feel like it would not 
have been the media storm that it was the CDC would not be 
_lose with all the new reports that it is received if the 
boss and protocols that are on the books currently 
for followed so in conclusion I would like to _declaration 
requesting that investigation be done thank you ma'am thank you 
we're a little over the time but, 
next witness thank you my name is _lecture I am a english teacher 
in los angeles unified school district I'm currently on leave from my teaching assignment as president of united 
features los angeles representing the thirty six thousand teachers and health and human services professionals 
_st the system that we have in place 
for oversight of our profession has largely worked for the last forty years and _
_throughout california I would repeat what _I would emphasize women's 
_proceeding _is just said that to the extent that problems have arisen in 
LA USD they have been at their heart problems that have been built 
on LA USD failing to just charges duties under the current scheme of law?
The is the built before you will do two things will be very harmful.
Going forward first.
All professional 
competence panels in any profession need to have practitioners on them and that 
means a professional confidence panel regarding teachers need to have _on removing 
_teacher removing the teacher representation on a professional _
panel means removing the confidence it also means removing the _
I _a professional and it's the mark of any profession 
that members that profession have a central role ensuring quality 
and in policing misconduct in their profession that's true 
of doctors stroeve lawyers and it should be proved teachers if you wish us 
to provide professional services as we do 
every day you expect us to take on responsibilities of a profession which we do 
every day we must be accorded the ability to be part of that process this 
bill removes the teacher participation in 
the professional confidence competence hearing process.
And, the previous witness spoke about how 
_the boot camp for training folks who are on these confidence panels the 
_appointees one appointed by the district one appointed by the 
_teacher routinely under current law 
_professional confidence _vote three zero 
dismiss people routinely that happens 
in other words the person who was appointed by the _votes?
To dismiss because professional competence panel hears evidence, 
evidence is evidence and misconduct is misconduct wean 
teachers above all want to keep the standards of our profession high 
_keep our profession clean but we need to be part of that oversight 
process if that process is to be at all credible and then finally v 
changing the law this propose that would make the decision of the 
of panel and the ministry _should say advisory.
The current system is fair and it is I will use the word again 
credible it takes politics out of the process and let's pretend for a moment that the 
preceding CMinor we've gone were okay, I will hayward won so I will finish _you.
A fine teacher, for example, is rocker _we used _example this 
morning was speaking to some of the members controversy all opinionated a pain in the 
next to school board members day-in-and-day-out _thank you?
But, a fantastic teacher.
A professional _panels here evidence school 
board vote on policy there's a reason that school boards do what 
they do and fact-finding panels do what they do in 
injecting politics into the process _situation where 
someone will be found to be to use the previous witnesses phrase a _
Because their _to be _votes in the school border three votes on the school board 
remove that person as opposed to a factual 
_what did and didn't happen under all 
that process would be obvious if you if you take 
teacher dismissal you make it a political process you will be undermining 
the basic tenets of the system we've had for forty years department _
_work for forty years I would probably like I what _
_brown I will be I was just with one since I will be _a similar petition _rather similar 
decoration thank _you very much and now we'll just state your name 
_organization _I'm here on behalf of the california federation of teachers _
_the educational issues committee _secondary 
_president you tell a _I won the _to sort of _
_sort of _some of the testimony in the support side and I'll tell have nothing but respect from 
_I've had the pleasure of voting _
_time sometimes constituent but I think is dead wrong on this bill I think that the only 
_did not follow the policies of _prescribe its failed to protect 
children this is a great way to cover for the district and it's unfortunate because I have tremendous respect from _
_I'm a teacher I'm a father thirteen-year-old I can 
count hundreds of my former students and their safety's important all teachers all 
_the _opinion chile and apply anything else it's nonsense and I 
would add this last thought _on american its on american-led one body _
_judge prosecution jury and executioner and that's unfortunate this 
_thank you very much other witnesses a in opposition name

to my profession I would _thank you next witness.

_for _that expedient dismissal _for teachers 
involving sex abuse drugs and violence against children that is correct 
okay one witness said the bill seems to not do what it says it does the way I read 
addresses issues with sex drugs and violence against 
children does it do that is correct okay and.
Does your bill eliminate due process for these teachers who may be 
want to than jacked to what they're being accused of _does not 
I think articulated _the provisions that maintained due process that granted 
fifty parallel process different than what _current law but is due process 
stimulus _cause there's seems to be on opposition site eighty, 
eighty _here that 
eliminates due process but does not limit due process they can still file an appeal and, 
you have a grievance heard correct that is correct them happy to a 
reiterate adobe affirms direct presented defense the right to be represented by counsel the 
right to _just close to the rights reason witnesses the _request hearing 
by independent orbiter _in above and beyond that they're still 
asses in current law legal recourse for wrongful termination none of that 
is being taken away _I guess my last question is that it's not 
_in the way I read it so just _if I'm if I'm wrong _I read your 
_it's not it's not 
_or ambiguous about what drugs violence and 
sex against children is it's actually very narrowly defined so 
like somebody can get dismissed for basically _marijuana you would have to be 
sent and regis tight dread correct that's correct _
_narrowly defined it's not just drugs in general per okay 
great thank you thank you any other questions or 
comments the must be canada I'm sorry mr williams and _you can?
senator I want to first of all of say that I really appreciate the _
I think from the past history of this committee and 
_willing to look at _the night bill 
_we want to take efforts to improve 
the system of removing teachers that engaging criminal acts.
I do have can some concerns about the changes in the 
_I do think that in 
cases of you know.
Violence at the 
wisdom of having a teacher on a involved 
in the dismissal procedure is important and _
you know, I again I would hope that you would 
reconsider and be willing to you know, I _the bill to 
preserve the CDC procedure as it is even if that meant whitening 
_the eligibility to more teachers _serve on it a 
_because right now the rules are they have to be five years within the same 
subject matter that's the kind of thing that I think would be a good compromise in this case 
is still a 
_like your intent and I just can't support of a 
less than tell you could make that kind of change and.
This weekend.
I missed the beginning of the test money but.
You know, I have friends on both sides of this issue 
You know, I see so many people including people on this panel many of whom or bascule 
_members who care very deeply about our children who care about their 
safety who want them to get the very best education possible so I 
believe the motive and intent on the parts of people on both 
sides is the right one but, when I look at this I think they're areas this bill 
were really thing when I was _intellectually dishonest 
because there is nothing in this bill?
That would _the situation for mare monte happening so 
we think we're providing additional protections by passing this bill.
Or not and for those teachers that testified 
_myself having been a long-term school board member what we do in terms of the 
training of our teachers the training of our administrators are communications with our parents 
as they recognizes problem so that report improperly _critically 
important and goes farther to preventing these incidences and 
catching them earlier than what we do on the 
_and, whether or not we take our evaluation and we take _reporting 
responsibilities seriously also goes a long way but, you know, 
that some people seem to believe that if we pass this bill over going to 
eliminate the situations that's just not true.
Then I 
had brought up well you know, LA had just men forty thousand dollars.
As a settlement to go to dismissal but there's nothing 
in this bill that would have prevented that same situation in fact, 
you know, because you still going to go through the same administrative process most _
_probably say look, you know, 
let's avoid the negative publicity let's take care of it was let's do that the times I had 
this happen on when I was on school board, you know, 
we immediately notified the authorities we brought 
and independent counsel to investigate with _did all the things right and we 
never had problems dismissing employees in fact much of what you're talking about in this 
_virtually all of it actually can already be done under 
existing law so when I take a look at this my spent is more time on 
this still frankly than some of my own bills because it got so complicated I 
would go from one section of code to another I think there is a lot we need to do I mean 
I think there's work we need to do to approve the teacher evaluation 
process I think there's work we need to do I know where the school more members and the administrators 
are frustrated because it's a long expensive process so I think there's work we need to 
do to try and streamline the process and make it more efficient for everybody so we can get 
_and not spend so much money but I don't think your bill 
_the right bill and I think we need time to sit down and get it right and, 
this doesn't get it right there is a teacher in a school district _in my assembly 
district that got accused of sexual misconduct because the student 
_great she wasn't happy with.
You know, under your bill if you're 
_you can go to dismissal in which case you're putting people in 
a position of trying to determine whether there's criminal activity that shouldn't be there 
that person deserves due process and doesn't deserve to have 
_refutation real so I think there's work we need to do 
that I can't support this bill because I don't think it's the right solution although I also had 
applied to for trying to do something and I and I think everyone here on both 
sides for coming today because all _should be outrage, you know, 
if there's any place where school should be a child should be safe it 
should be in our schools and what happened miramonte the is not acceptable to me I 
don't think is acceptable to anyone in this room and we have to be able to deal with it and 
_ultimately when we deal with that I don't want to streamline the process just for 
certain egregious cases let's find a way to streamline the process 
and make it work better and all the dismissal cases?
Thank you 
_chair and I had a question I apologize _that percent 
_room my understanding of from reading the analysis and the 
bill is that.
One of the differences.
In the disciplinary or dismissal process.
Is that?
There would be administrative law judge under your belt.
Versus.
The _pc.
Which is a final decision the administrative law judge?
Renders a opinion.
Whereas under existing law _pc a 
_a vote which I assume is stuff is the binding decision.
_the correct roughly.
If the question is what's current lol then _
pc makes the decision under my bill it's not a 
_it did _judge singularly fishing advisor advisory opinion 
the question is there any evidence to show that the result would be different.
_appreciated questionable got a lot of comments from the committee 
without a question because they have a lot of responses to the issues that have been brought up by the members and certainly by the 
_this is what I _of the appropriate time on 
_responded to questions aren't answered I'm just not but I 
_question _there's _that it would be different there's no 
_because the system has been this way for decades hasn't been 
an alternative mechanism to measure up against so I wish I can give you 
a parable evidence but, I can tell you this.
A narrow cases sex drugs 
_children it's almost as one of the points that was brought up by some remember 
williams so, the value of having a teacher or a 
_if you will on the _
A summer subject matter within five years etc when 
it comes to be a various other grounds for dismissal 
_from current law.
_of professional conduct the unsatisfactory performance to 
everyone fitness for service as a teacher the conditions and feeding him or 
construct the persistent violation of refusal, refusal to be school 
up etc in those instances I see the value in 
having a teacher _because and _I know _
_issues of a teacher or other certificate personal.
When it comes to the clearly defined shares 
an egregious crimes?
Of drug use.
Of sex.
With students.
Of violence against children clearly defined in current code.
I don't see _the relevance or added value of 
the teachers in the panel versus VEight legal expertise of 
_yeah, my question related to whether.
Where you have?
A administrative law judge.
For example, ready opinion and another state.
Jurisdiction in which.
That methodology has proven to be.
Value towards question but _can see here and say yes because use administrative law judge 
_to perform functions of the _for example, or in other areas of 
long I'm talking _and that will quickly be countered by all but that's different that's 
not teaching that's different because that's _right though I 
appreciate the question I really do what I'm asking you to consider is in these never cases 
but _initial by judge does _
You know, crimes defined _already and, the _of a school board 
to make pharmacists let me tell you why I asked that question senator 
information _the _council familiar see the that's the question _
_answer on your question the notion about due process being taken 
away and proposed bill I'm not asking that question you're asking exam elsewhere 
_lg _a masking were now _setting.
Let me tell you why I'm asking that question so that.
We're clear first of all I.
Tremendously agree there's a problem.
And, being a school 
board member administrator and facing.
Righteous anger and indignation.
Of a parents.
Who have _
Must be unimaginable.
But, let me share with you my experience.
I have a relatively recently.
Any family member of mine.
Sexually molested.
Someone who is very vulnerable.
Lack of my site.
I don't take this lightly.
Discover that had occurred.
And, I won't even mention.
What I wanted to due to the individual whose identified 
clearly identify _face the criminal process?
But, I also know.
For me it's important.
To make sure.
The option presented for due process and 
justice is something that has been tested.
To my satisfaction I served on a _which we 
discipline a license professionals and state of california 
_for four years.
I was head of the enforcement committee work with the l j.
And, I can tell you.
And, I can tell you that.
Their opinion.
Is probably?
As useful as the _pc but I couldn't prove it.
But, I certainly 
would like to have that comfort level of knowing.
That we're taking one system.
That is alleged to be 
inadequate and we'll take your word for it for another system.
In which I don't have.
Yet that comfort 
level and until I have that I will have questions about the solution.
If I can answer your 
quite questions into ace number one as the law currently exist there 
_a process in place where it's 
a OJ who makes the decision and _decision is 
_and that's with respect to 
teachers rights to be laid-off _imagine 
release nearly opera process so when school board to make a decision 
laying off teachers that decision is assigned to the same a 
OJ out of OH office of administrative hearing and that opinion of that 
_advisory.
And, the school were makes a final decision so in that.
Process a school board have 
_final authority to lay off thousands of teachers based on 
advisory opinion _a _
Whereas _I believe it's still 
_seeking to do is give that same discretion to the school board 
to dismiss a teacher who's been founder accused of molesting a child.
_that point just on that point afraid so what you're saying is that.
That _system has proven to be better 
than CBC.
That it has were and _has not _anyone of due process.
Better, better more efficient more expedient also.
You don't have to panel and panel 
_two other folks say it's just one hearing being decided by one person making that 
decision who's capable of taking an evidence and also able to 
render a decision _advisory to support.
In the same way that a jury trial is cumbersome.
It takes more time.
Places I.
In the same way that a jury trial is 
cumbersome possibly more costly than a judge trial.
That per say on that basis.
To me it's not sufficient persuasive.
By thank you for years prior honest assessment of 
_thank you mr eying the mistral me on _
yeah, thank _and I will try to be briefing and that 
_you senator for waiting a into these lawyers.
They are if the contentious issue I know you would prefer a 
questions my shoot I _apologize to 
_my sense of it is 
a their responses would be really interpretation of perspective just like I have 
_full disclosure was a teacher for twenty nine years and, I'm just _very 
I think _unfinished project I I'm a little uncomfortable with 
iphones because it's very combat _so, that tells me that the air is not 
_clear _you may be taking the right first step 
but I do feel that the journey toward _
Completion it's going to take a little more work I'd be happy to work with you on something 
like this _we we're afraid there's the fear factor here 
on all of us what happened was what was horrible the blame game is 
a natural _calling up state legislators and say you've got 
to help us is _response that's why we get 
_let its _cheap _sometimes deal with these most extremely 
_if you don't if you don't like teachers' union 
_a affect how you see this bill if you love teachers and, 
_will that I don't think we're I don't have 
to clarity yet I think we have the intent I think we have the intelligence and, 
the _and if you're from LA can't _open _
chewed and I'm really questioning _on why you're behind.
And, I think the senator understands what I'm saying _not about him _
your elected we have a scandal currently in san francisco I'm kinda interested 
in any unify taking a position on this without talking to me 
_I find that offensive too so I just _some dirty laundry?
The scandal is getting _eventually _board of supervisors _
_of those supervisors has a constituency reads 
_history with this particular individual I don't think that the 
board of supervisors really want to do what they're being brought into do I 
know I wouldn't I _do whatever they have to 
_with _board of education I was on the board of education for a long-time as 
buchanan said you're going to have a people on both sides to this issue.
I don't think that's the body to make the decision it's not 
this getting a pink slip is not the same as having your life _to the gutter and then you're, 
you're put in jail we're and we're not we're not looking at the context.
Of _all we're not looking at parents you were afraid to report because 
they're not citizens what is _about I don't mean that is a distraction under strange say that there's 
a context here so I'm not going to be able to support _but I urge you I 
_you just continue and that we may never get to the come by because there might be something 
some still uncomfortable 
with but I really feel this needs to be finished more and we need a 
little more cooperation and we do a combatants and anyway, 
I'm sorry I didn't preceeding the way _you would have preferred but, 
you know, I do on _what you're doing I do _
A doctor holden.
Just briefly my understanding is that this bill is not about 
_unions it's not about.
Teachers principle school boards it's about kids.
Having recently.
Undergone a tragedy in the region I represent which is the central valley 
_in which case one of our kids was molested.
I have a hard time putting anything above the welfare about child.
The damage that's been done maybe irreparable I appreciate what you're doing 
in surgery we have a saying let not perfect be enemy as good 
_perfect bill but I think it's a good bill and I hope 
_forward.
Thank you thank you any other 
comments I think I'd like to make a comment and then you can clothes _
_to don't have a questions I think I know 
that still as well as I've known any of my bills and if 
_through the legislature I do believe the bill is very nearly 
_for a teacher or any other certified a personnel 
with the school district who and the very rare circumstance 
_who sexually abuse a child or if you abuses 
a children through a violent act or through neglect 
or who engages with students with illegal drugs this is the definition 
_in this bill a very nero a happens in 
a very rare set of circumstances I certainly 
_net with the author in my office and wanted _
_author to but except amendments that we discussed but today I'm going 
to hear on the _of this _will give school districts from some tools 
and their toolbox to address the very rare and unspeakable acts that 
_a occur in the future and, 
we'll make it more definitive and maybe a little bit more efficient and, 
at the same time hopefully ensure due process so 
I will support the bill today but I don't know if _votes are here but, 
I think the I 
_senator and you want to stakeholders _commit yourselves 
to improving upon this bill to ensure that there 
Absolute certainty that the measurable strike right now 
_when these horrendous actions apr to protect 
children first and foremost and, to ensure the due process of teachers 
is not taken away when?
Fall allegations are charges 
that could and will most likely sometime in the future 
happen but, today I am a willing to 
support the bill as you have presented and I will let you _
Not think miniature clearly _
_people substantive in a import discussion _
_discussion because of the subject matter _particular order right do you want to 
_to issues that raised by various members of the committee and, 
the witnesses particular those and proposition I mean I think it'd be helpful to point out 
that we talk about a certificate personal remember being 
dismissed _teacher's certificate personnel is a section 
of the law that we're talking about because there's already a different structure for classify 
personal some people say well this wouldn't have _what happened that made a month or at 
tell for elementary my own elementary school in the wake of me 
_monthly or what happened in fontana within this last 
year or san clemente just last year for now for or 
marietta borror oxnard of merced county?
On so, for the purposes of a declarations percy RTC.
Investigations I think there's more declarations that ought to be crafted _you respect 
_process that _place so, 
there's issues of how.
And, how quickly it's get _
And, then there's the notice piece from administration to 
v certificate personal member and then there's the distance.
Where my bills focusing on is 
the dismissal process because it's exactly whatever from 
superintendent in school board members throughout the state that it's okay once?
Somethings brought to our attention and we can 
for the time being try to remove an individual from 
_function from their job _student safety.
What's the process for dismissing when there is the information 
evidence necessary and the current process in place.
They find at times in this 
these most serious entry just cases to be lengthy.
And, in that length very costly.
And, if the consideration _do you consider going down 
a lengthy costly legal process or given your budget reality?
_sometimes forty thousand dollars seems like a bargain to get.
And, individual out of your school system in the interest of the students 
in the interests of your treasury.
That's not good.
That's not good for any superintendent or any school board member 
instructed for the public of california but there's that distinction 
_one of the call out between reporting and maybe we need to do more in that 
space the notice and then the special we're talking about the dismissal of some remember 
williams talked earlier about having concerns about the violence piece of this 
bill and, 
maybe there's perspective that you can bring to the panel to address _violence 
_and example that was given what if the teacher use contact 
_break-up a fight section a one six five-point-four the appeal 
_think is pretty clear I will _but it does distinguish, you know, 
you supports _when it comes to a falling into service 
_any physical injury or person or damage to property for purposes of 
self-defense a terror terrorist I think it's already _articulated in the code.
_for part of my ongoing response _process question _
kind of _committee _as you were talking in a couple nowhere in the committee now says _
_statement that the proposal 
bill compromises due process I think if that would have been a fighting.
Or glaring the analysis would have said 
so in fact when it comes to the paddle that's incredible.
Just curl up provides the _with the our to make a file decision about 
_suspension a in practice a certain different, 
different place the first member and chairperson of the 
_is an administrative law judge.
This members responsibility is 
_that the legal rights of all parties _protected at _here.
With or without teachers on the panel.
It is vest members responsibility to sure that the legal rights including 
due process.
Of all parties are protected at the hearing _but at least 
_question of what _be pressure on school boards to act, you know, 
response to political pressures _outcry 
_terror being from the analysis again under the section of 
_five-fifteen _governing board in practice however it seems unlikely 
_governing board deviate from the administrative _decision even if 
_decision is only advisory suction at such an action but like 
the encourage the certificate employee _
_talks about legal recourse available afterwards and a _
of other elements amendments were given to me just this week I understand that originated from the she 
_how to expedite the timeframe for the dismissal process not just 
in the cases I'm referring to _available for all cases I think they ought to be considered 
_we hear from districts that the length of time and the cost of 
a is problematic I was still argue that in 
_particular case _no cases of 
_the bill the process I propose is still very much appropriate 
I've already spoken to but I think the relevant to the value-added teachers on 
a panel for the cases _versus the others 
are grounds for dismissal I believe I _response one of the questions 
at this maybe a different process that proposing versus per law _
_due process nonetheless that any 
a personal member still has legal recourse for wrongful termination 
that staying even with the bill this _five to certificate personnel not just 
teachers _administrators once upon a time _teachers 
and are treated as such a by wall and last but not least?
_rockers sort _presentation by reminding us of the more some case.
And, I think it's divorcing case specifically _put the standards in 
place that will help ensure the proper and appropriate application of 
_fifteen third.
Indeed.
Any _employee whose subject 
_have to due process protections because of the structure put in 
_by that more _case that is not affected by the 
bill that has helped frame the bill that is before you with that I respectfully 
ask _thank you very much thank you center and is _motion on the bill?
_like doctor haldeman second by mr _so, 
there's a motion in a second emotion is a 
_path amended to the appropriations committee _caldwell 
_I from the ain _I _I know.
I mean I don't know buchanan you _know butler.
Harder not voting in southern.
And, not voting growth.
_older meant haldeman I wagner, wagner I williams.
It has _to leave your own bill on-call messengers.
Thank you and, now we moved to.
_walters bill.
No, or corbett I'm sorry excuse me _corbett still _
you know.
This _welcome _twelve _BTwelve.
Seventy-one _thank you very much madame chair I also have been 
asked _percent senator can cox measures alterius have very 
_so I think they should go rather quickly very good I'll do my best?
Thank you very much members let me start _
_is _trust anyone let me start by thinking the committee staff 
_further analysis and the recommendations from 
limits I'm happy to take the committee amendments as office and then minutes and 
were also adding co-authors as part of those amendments to thank you for that.
In december two thousand eleven _state audit on the division of the state architect and 
_the fact that the state architect 
had not certified a number of completed school construction projects to confirm 
that they met seismic safety standards the audit also found out that the state 
architect did not provide comprehensive oversight of projects 
and did not effectively document the risk level of unsure to 
five projects the bottom line is the state 
_not effectively provided school construction oversight and 
compliance with the field act which is a very serious issue raising the 
risk that some school facilities being used by children might be unsafe during an earthquake?
Members here on education I know, you know, 
that over six _are sent _public school buildings every single-day
